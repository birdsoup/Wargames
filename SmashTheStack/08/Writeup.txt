This level was fun. It is pretty straightforward. The goal is to overflow the annotation buffer to overwrite the vtable pointer. Fill up the buffer with a fake vtable and point the vtable pointer to your buffer. The fake vtable entry has a single entry that points to the shellcode. 
Curiously enough, my go-to 23-byte shellcode did not work, but I found another 25-byte one that did :)
